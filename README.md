## Project Structure

### Understanding `.jsw` Files
The `src/backend/` folder contains `.jsw` files, which are Wix-specific **Web Modules**. These files are used in Wix to define server-side functions that can be securely called from the frontend. They serve as a bridge between the frontend and backend, allowing certain operations (e.g., database queries and secure computations) to be handled on the server side.

In this repository, the `.jsw` files are preserved to maintain the original structure of the Wix project. If you‚Äôre not using Wix, consider these as standard `.js` files but note that some functions and syntax may not be compatible outside of Wix.

## Future Enhancements
Some planned features and improvements for RatePsiProfessor include:

- üì± **Mobile Optimization**: Enhance the mobile UI for a seamless user experience.
- üîê **Automated Spell Check**: Prevent duplicate professor pages caused by minor typos or inconsistent spellings in submissions by implementing a custom-coded spell-check feature
- üìä **Automated Professor Profile Enrichment**: Automatically populate new professor pages with relevant information such as subject, RateMyProfessor link, and headshot
